Secure one time passwords sharing

# One-Time Secret Clone PRD

## 1. Product Overview

We're seeking to develop a clone of OneTimeSecret.com using Go. This application will allow users to share sensitive information securely by creating a link to a secret message that can only be viewed once before being destroyed.

## 2. Objectives

- Create a secure, Go-based clone of OneTimeSecret.com
- Implement core functionality of creating and sharing one-time viewable secrets
- Ensure high security standards for data transmission and storage
- Provide a clean, intuitive user interface

## 3. Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Secret Creation

- Allow users to input a secret message or text
- Generate a unique, secure link for the secret
- Implement optional password protection for secrets
- Allow users to set an expiration time for the secret

### 3.2 Secret Retrieval

- Enable secret viewing through the generated link
- Implement one-time viewing mechanism (secret destruction after viewing)
- Support password entry for protected secrets

### 3.3 Security

- Use AES-256 encryption for storing secrets
- Implement secure random generation for secret keys and passwords
- Ensure all communications are over HTTPS
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks

### 3.4 User Interface

- Create a clean, responsive web interface
- Provide clear instructions for users
- Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality for generated links

### 3.5 API

- Develop a RESTful API for programmatic secret creation and retrieval
- Implement proper authentication for API access

## 4. Technical Requirements

- Backend must be written in Go
- Use a suitable web framework (e.g., Gin, Echo, or Fiber)
- Implement proper logging and error handling
- Use a reliable database for storing encrypted secrets (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Containerize the application using Docker

## 5. User Flows

### 5.1 Creating a Secret
1. User visits the homepage
2. User enters the secret text
3. User (optionally) sets a password and expiration time
4. User submits the form
5. System generates a unique link
6. User copies the link to share

### 5.2 Viewing a Secret
1. Recipient clicks on the shared link
2. If password-protected, recipient enters the password
3. System displays the secret
4. System destroys the secret after viewing

## 6. Security Considerations

- Implement proper input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Ensure secrets are not logged or cached
- Use secure random number generation for all tokens and keys
- Implement proper key management practices

## 7. Performance Requirements

- Application should handle at least 100 concurrent users
- Secret creation and retrieval should complete in under 5 seconds

## 8. Testing Requirements

- Implement unit tests for all core functions
- Conduct security audits and penetration testing
- Perform load testing to ensure performance requirements are met

## 9. Documentation

- Provide clear API documentation
- Include setup instructions for local development and deployment
- Document security practices and encryption methods used

## 10. Deliverables

- Source code hosted on a public GitHub repository
- Docker configuration for easy deployment
- Comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
- API documentation

## 11. Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and adherence to Go best practices
- Security of the implementation
- Completeness of features compared to OneTimeSecret.com
- Quality of documentation
- Performance under load

## 12. Bounty Details

- Bounty Amount: $2500
- Submission Deadline: Dec 31 2024
- Evaluation Period: 6 weeks

## 13. Submission Process

1. Fork the designated GitHub repository
2. Implement the project according to the PRD
3. Submit a pull request with your implementation
4. Include any necessary documentation in the pull request
5. If you have any questions, create it as an issue on this repo

## 14. Additional Notes
